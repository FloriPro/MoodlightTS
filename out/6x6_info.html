            EXAMPLE: *;T08;IFF0000000000;"rot ";W0000;I00FF00000000;"gruen ";W0000;I0000FF000000;"blau
            ";W0000;IFFFFFF000000;<br>
            RESULT: Set morph-speed to 8, set foreground-color to red and background to black, display text
            "rot ", wait for scrolling end, set foreground green, display text "gruen ", wait again for
            scrolling to complete, set foreground to blue, display text "blau ", wait for end of
            text-display, reset to default ink (bg: black, fg: white)<br><br>
            EXAMPLE: *;D;IFFFFFFFF00FF;J8;W0020;IFFFFFF00FFFF;J8;W0020;IFFFFFFFFFF00;J8;W0020;R0100;<br>
            RESULT: Start loop, set foreground-color to white and background-color to magenta, shift display
            down (always one pixel), wait 200 ms, set foreground-color to white and background-color to
            cyan, shift display down, wait 200 ms, set foreground-color to white and background-color to
            yellow, wait 200 ms, repeat 100 times from loop-start<br>
            <br>
            <h3>PUSH BUTTON</h3>
            Press button to cycle through presets on bank A<br>
            Store a single @ in a preset to reset button-cycle to preset 01 (e.g. @ in preset 5 will give
            folowing button-cycle-sequence: 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4......)<br>
            If no preset with @ exists, button will cycle from 1 to 99 and then start again at preset 1 of
            bank A, banks will never automatically switch!<br>
